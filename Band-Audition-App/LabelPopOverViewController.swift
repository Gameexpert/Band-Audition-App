    let rhythmicAccuracy: String = "Rhythmic Accuracy is scored on the amount of rhythmic errors made while playing any of the etudes or sight reading. Rhythms include accurate playing and lengths of rolls. Each rhythmic error will reduce the score by 1 point."
    let pitchAccuracy: String = "Pitch Accuracy is scored on the amount of individually melodic errors made while playing any of the etudes or sight reading. Each missed pitch will reduce the score by 1 point."
    let tempoAccuracy: String = "Tempo Accuracy is scored on the amount of measures played accurately to the marked tempo for the etude or sight reading. For every 5 beats-per-minute off of the written tempo, 1 point will be deducted (5 bpm off = 1, 10 bpm off = 2, etc.).  For every bar that is played with a tempo fluctuation or inconsistency, 2 points will be deducted. "
    let dynamicAccuracy: String = "Dynamic Accuracy is scored on the amount of dynamic mistakes made during any of the etudes or sight reading.  Score is determined based on how many dynamic markings exist in the excerpt.  If there are only two separate dynamics, then each one is worth 10 points.  If there are three, each dynamic is worth 7 points (7+7+6).  That pattern continues on to fluctuate for each excerpt."
    let soundProduction: String = "Sound Production is scored on the quality of sound produced on the appropriate instrument. Snare head playing positions and where mallets are striking the timpani and marimba bars are the focal point. For every measure that includes an error or inconsistent sound production, 1-2 points will be deducted."
